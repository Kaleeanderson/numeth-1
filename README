The code:
Python code that creates the initial conditions utilizing the MERCURY package.
initial_positions.py

to run:
python initial_positions.py

outputs:
initial_pos.txt
Which consists of the initial conditions of the planets and Sun along with 100 asteroids.

The leapfrog integrator is made in fortran:
leapfrog.f90

to make:
make test

to run:
./test

This outputs a data file for each particle
data_*.txt

It also prints out the start and stop times of the integration.

The orbits of the planets can be plotted with 
display_orbit.py

to run:
python display_orbit.py

The fractional change in energy as a function of can be plotted with
leapfrog_energy.py

to run: 
python leapfrog_energy.py
